# Bioexcel building blocks workflows

These workflows can be run together or as independent workflows. They use BioExcel Building Blocks (biobb) to integrate different popular biomolecular simulation tools. This software has been developed for the [European BioExcel](http://bioexcel.eu/), funded by the European Commission (EU Horizon Europe [101093290](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101093290)).

**Protein interface** workflows to study protein-protein interactions.

**Single protein** workflows to study the effect of mutations, disulfide bonds, starting conformation... on the conformation of an active site, do a cavity analysis and a virtual screening.
