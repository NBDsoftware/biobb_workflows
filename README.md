# Bioexcel building blocks workflows

These workflows can be run together or as independent workflows. They use BioExcel Building Blocks (biobb) to integrate different popular biomolecular simulation tools.

**Protein interface** workflows to study protein-protein interactions, analyze cavities and do a virtual screening on those cavities.

**Single protein** workflows to study the effect of mutations, disulfide bonds, starting conformation... on the conformation of an active site, do a cavity analysis and a virtual screening.

**SuMD** contains workflows related to supervised MD simulations and their analysis.
